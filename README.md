# Seiwa Hint

1. Provide visual feedback for Seiwa with Arduino + LCD1602 (with brightness control).
1. Allows mouse control with a joystick.

Currently, this works by interfacing with seiwa-bridge.

TODO: Ideally this should work by using Arduino Due (with USB host support) as a bridge between Seiwa keyboard and PC.
